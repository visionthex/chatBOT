This is a web application that uses Google's Generative AI to create a unique user experience. The application has a responsive navigation bar that appears when the mouse is near the edges of the screen.

## Code Overview

### main.js

The `main.js` file is responsible for the interactivity of the navigation bars and handling user inputs.

When the mouse moves within 250px of the left or right edge of the screen, the corresponding navigation bar expands to 200px. If the mouse moves away from the edge, the navigation bar contracts.

The `sendButton` and `clearButton` are used to handle user inputs. The `userInput` field is where the user can enter their input.

The application also has a feature to save `conversations`. The saved conversations can be accessed from the right navigation bar.
